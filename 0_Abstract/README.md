## Seat Monitoring System based on Temperature: Currently many people are looking for the Advanced Technologies.This system presents a Microcontroll(atmega328) based Seat measurement system to dectect and confirm the presence/absence of person on the seat. In this system the sensor will sense is the driver has been seated or not and if the driver seated then the temperature need to be set accordingly. Based on the controller it will set the temperature and it is capable of maintaining of heat in the vehicles seats. And whatever the heat is generated that point it will be displaying on displays like (Liquid crystal display (LCD),Light emitting diode (LED) backlit LCD, Thin film Transistors (TFT) LCD)

## Components used
### 1. ATMEGA 328
#### It is commonly used in many projects and autonomous systems where a simple, low-powered, low cost micro-controller is needed
### 2. Temperature Sensors.
#### It is a device used to measure temperature.
### 3. Heat generator
### 4. Thermostat.
#### used for electric current to a heating or cooling.
### 5. LCD
#### Liquid Crystal Display used to display Temperature- Generated heat.
### 6. LED
#### Light Emitting Diode used as indicator
## Features
1.It sense whether the person is existed or not.   
2.The person can request, the Heater accordinging to that the heat will generate.  
3.This system is reliable.  
4.The person can modify the temperature by observing the display which is given in the system.  
5.It is compitable.   

 ## SWOT Analysis- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats
 ## Strength
 1.Low cost and compitable system.
 2.User Friendly.
 3.Easy to modify the temperature values.
 4.It is efficient and convenient.

 ## Weakness
 1.It can be used only in europian countries.
 2.Low sensitivity.

## Opportunities
1.It can be implemented by replacing heater by air conditioners.
2.It will be helpful in all the countries.

## Threats
Because of low senstivity it will not suitable in high temperature Environment.

## 4W's and 1'H
## Why
It can monitoring our body temperature even when we are healthy and it can help to detect disease early and help us if it is okay to go to work or college or school.

## What
Seat Monitoring System based on Temperature.

## When
It can be used in only Low temperature.

## Where  
It can be used in Industries like Automobile.

## How
It can be modified by changing the Temperature.

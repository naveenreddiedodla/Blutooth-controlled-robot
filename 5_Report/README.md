# Working Principle
## AUTOMATIC SEAT HEAT CONTROLLER:
### This Controller aims to control the temperature in the car. Whenever a person seated in the car, And when button is pushed the button sensor activated and heater sensor also activated after it. Temperature sensor keeps track of the temperature and sends analog value to atmega328 microcontroller. Microcontroller performs certain operations and produce the required output.
###  ATMEGA 328
#### It is commonly used in many projects and autonomous systems where a simple, low-powered, low cost micro-controller is needed
###  Temperature Sensors.
#### It is a device used to measure temperature.
###  Heat generator
###  Thermostat.
#### used for electric current to a heating or cooling.
###  LCD
#### Liquid Crystal Display used to display Temperature- Generated heat.
###  LED
#### Light Emitting Diode used as indicator
